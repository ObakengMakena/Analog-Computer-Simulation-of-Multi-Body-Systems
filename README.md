# Analog-Computer-Simulation-of-Multi-Body-Systems


Welcome to the repository for my final year engineering project on simulating multibody systems using analog computers. This project focuses on the simulation of differential equations for a single and double pendulum, comparing ideal and real circuit simulations in MATLAB Simulink. The repository includes all the necessary simulation files and code.

## Project Overview

This project explores the application of analog computing in the simulation of multibody systems, specifically targeting the movement of robotic arms modeled as rigid bodies. The key components of the project are:

- **Analog Computer Simulation**: Creating an analog computer in MATLAB Simulink to simulate the differential equations of a single and double pendulum.
- **Ideal vs Real Circuits**: Comparing the outputs of an ideal Simscape simulation with a simulation that incorporates real op-amp parameters such as slew rate and bandwidth.
- **Spring-Mass-Damper System**: Application of analog computing principles to a spring-mass-damper system.

## Repository Contents

- **Simulation Files**: MATLAB Simulink models for single and double pendulum simulations.
- **Code Files**: Scripts and functions used in the simulations and analysis.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanations of the models, comparisons, and results.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/multibody-simulation.git
   ```

2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the cloned repository directory.

3. Run the simulation files in MATLAB Simulink:
   - `final_single_pendulum_sim.slx`
   - `final_double_sim.slx`
   - 'real_pendulum.slx'
   - 'real_double_pendulum.slx'
     


4. Execute the analysis scripts to compare the results of ideal and real circuit simulations.

## Project Details

- **Single Pendulum Simulation**: Simulates the differential equation of a single pendulum, comparing the ideal and real circuit outputs.
- **Double Pendulum Simulation**: Extends the single pendulum model to a double pendulum, representing two links of a robotic arm.
